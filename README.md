# ludusavi-emudeck-manifest
Additional [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi) manifest for finding save location of emulators based on information on the [emudeck wiki.](https://emudeck.github.io/save-management/steamos/save-management/)

## How To Us:

### 1. Add manifest to Ludusavi

You can add the manifest in the "other" tab and adding the new manifest to the list.

### 2. Update roots (if needed)

If you've installed Emudeck on a seperate drive (or SD card), you'll want to make sure that drive is configured as a "home folder" in Ludusavi. I just duplicated my SD card location. So I had 2, one configured as a steam drive and one configured as a home folder.


## Known issues:

Windows is not setup to work. If anyone is interested in this, just setup a PR and we can figure it out together.
